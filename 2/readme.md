## Waltz-Controls Message Exchange Specification

The core feature of Waltz-Controls is ability to exchange messages beetween a number of upstream controls systems, as well as 3rd party components and GUIs in general refered as *endpoint*s. Therefore the main idea to keep in mind when designing this message specification is the following: when a field is related to a message routing or processing it goes to the upper level, otherwise i.e. when a field is an endpoint specific it goes into payload.


### Goals

Describe standard API for Magix component

### Magix API [raw]

Magix component of Waltz-Controls MUST define the following methods

```java

interface Magix {
   void broadcast(Message msg, Channel channel) throws IOException;

   Flowable<Message> subscribe(Channel channel, BackpressureStrategy strategy);
}

```
