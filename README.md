# Waltz-Controls Request For Comments (RFC)

This repository is the home of all Tango Open Specification.

## Mission

The goal of this RFC project is to provide a formal specification of Waltz Controls project. This specification shall include:

1. concepts,
2. terminology, 
3. protocol behaviour,
4. conventions,

each on a sufficient level for future evolution of Waltz Controls and/or implementation in other languages. In that respect, concepts are more important than implementation details.
